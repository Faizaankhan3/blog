First Ever Blog Post
<!--more-->

# Stepping into the writer's world.
Hi random visitor, you are either one of my friends I have forced to visit this place or someone who liked some work by the future me or maybe just the web crawler.
In my pursuit of learning and trying out things, with my baby turtle steps, I have realised one thing, that feeling confident about something and being confident enough to explain other people are two very different things. Just like living a moment and being able to share other people how you felt about it. The later provides me with extreme joy and maybe as a human acceptance from people makes me happy about it. In general, I am no good with conversations, or writing, but it's never too late right. So here's me starting to share the experiences I have with creating something, configuring something, hating something, and living something.

Wish me luck, and less procrastination.
